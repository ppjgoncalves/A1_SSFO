# Figures 7 and S4

1. run ``model_prediction_divisiveness.m`` to generate results for panel 7G. This will take less than 1 minute. In case one wants to bypass this step, we provide the pre-computed results in file ``divisive_model_error.mat``.

2. run ``figs_model.m`` to generate all panels of Figures 7 and S4.

## Requirements

MATLAB R2015b or above.
